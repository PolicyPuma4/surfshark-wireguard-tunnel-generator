# surfshark-wireguard-tunnel-generator
Generates Surfshark WireGuard tunnel files for all supported Surfshark servers using a provided private key.

What does this small app solve? Surfshark doesn't allow you to download all WireGuard tunnel files at once, and even if they did, they don't prefil the private key in the generated file.
